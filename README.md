# reading-list

This repo is totally inspired by https://github.com/jamietr1/reading-list

I've kept that kind of list offline, in a couple of journals, and just
wanted to have that in one place, without the reliance on "dead trees
notebook form".

So, here it it.

I try to adapt as many tags for the data as I need, and for now these
are:
* title
* author
* time I finished the book
* what format it was - audiobook, book, ebook
* would I recommend it to anyone?
* was that a reread?


Also, this repo will eventually contain not only list of books I've
read, but also lists of movies I've watched, and lists of books
to-be-read, etc. I like lists!
